Before building or running, please make sure you have the following properly downloaded and installed:
---> Python 2.7
---> Boto3 for Python 2.7
---> AWS CLI (OPTIONAL)

Also be sure that your credentials are properly configured by doing the following:

------->If you have the '.aws' folder in your user (~/) directory with the 'config' and 'credentials' files,
 	open the 'credentials' file and replace the fields to the right of 'aws_access_key_id = ' and
 	'aws_secret_access_key = ' with your Access Key ID and Secret Key respectively.
 	
------->If you don't have the '.aws' folder in your user (~/) directory, create '.aws' in that directory.
	Then, create a file called 'credentials'. Enter the following within it:
	
[default]
aws_access_key_id = KEY_ID_HERE
aws_secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
	
	
------->Alternatively, if you have AWS CLI installed, you can enter your credentials with the 'aws configure'
 	command.
 	
 	
 	
Run with Python 2.7 with the command "python backup.py"
